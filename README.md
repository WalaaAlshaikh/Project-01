## Overview:
![Image of app logo](https://b.top4top.io/p_2204its031.png)


This project represents an android application **Scrolly**,that allows user to express their thoughts and ideas with each other.It's more like a social media app.

## Technologies used:
This application was built using the following technologies:
### For Designing the logo of the app:
* Canva

* Adobe Photoshop
### For Designing the pages of the app"
* Figma 

* Adobe Photoshop
### For Programming the app:
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) for improving code quality.
* Android Architecture Components:MVVM,Navigation, Livedata.
* RecyclerViews & Adapters.
* Required Libraries
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)

 You are ready to develop!
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 
## Development Process and Problem-solving Strategy:
Firstly, Me and @Walaalshaikh brainstormed some ideas related to the requirement of the app and then took a general idea of the design and the mechanisim of some popular apps from app store
Secondly, We designed a logo according to the purpose of the app and gave it name.
Thirdly,We designed the screens each of them suitable for a specific action using the Figma and Photoshop,after that I statred programming the app using the android studio by dividing the project into several tasks to work on it: at first, I installed the required libraries and dependencies .
As for the obstacles that we faced,first we needed to decide the nature of the error (if it's syntax, runtime or logical), and then find the solution accordingly.Such solutions that can be disovered when debugging the error, using (Log.d)to specifty the location of the error, searching for similar cases online in [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and asking for the help of the experts.

## Unsolved Problems which would be fixed in future iterations:
* The issue of adding more than one picture in the post.
* completing on working on comments functionality
* Some conflects in ui regarding Localization (when switching from English into Arabic).
* some minor issues regarding the enhancment of the design to make the user expereince more dynamic.

## one of our favorite functions work:
* Localization
to switch from englidh into arabic
 
 ```kotlin
// in MainActivity.kt file
 private val localizationDelegate = LocalizationActivityDelegate(this)
        
 // in fragment file
 val localizationDelegate = LocalizationActivityDelegate(requireActivity())

        // set the language into Arabic when clicking on it
        binding.acivBotton.setOnClickListener {
            localizationDelegate.setLanguage(requireContext(),"ar")

        }
        // set the language into English when clicking on it
        binding.engButton.setOnClickListener{
            localizationDelegate.setLanguage(requireContext(),"en")

        }
```            
* using Meta (facebook) library for animation
 an Android library that provides an easy way to add a shimmer effect to any view in your Android app. It is useful as an unobtrusive loading indicator that was originally developed for Facebook Home.

 ```kotlin
 
 // Gradle dependency on Shimmer for Android
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.facebook.shimmer:shimmer:0.5.0'
}

in xml
<com.facebook.shimmer.ShimmerFrameLayout
     android:id="@+id/shimmer_view_container"
     android:layout_width="wrap_content"
     android:layout_height="wrap_content"
>
     ...(your complex view here)...
</com.facebook.shimmer.ShimmerFrameLayout>
 

```
